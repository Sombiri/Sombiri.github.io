### Research Philosophy

I approach research as a diligent exploration and analysis of scientific challenges aimed at not just confirming existing theories and facts but also pushing the boundaries of what we know. This dedication fuels my work in public health informatics, where I strive to make existing and new technologies not only accessible but also clear, usable and reusable.

My research interest includes but not limited to:

- Bioinformatics
- AI/ML
- Visualization
- Biomedical informatics
