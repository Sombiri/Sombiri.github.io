I am a PhD student at the [Phillipps-Universit√§t Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en) with the mentorship of [Prof. Dominik Heider](http://heiderlab.de/?page_id=146) and [Dr. Georges Hattab](https://ghattab.github.io/). My research lies at the intersection of Bioinformatics, DNA storage, and Data Visualization. Currently, I work on providing solution for long-term information storage problems that are based on based on the molecular storage media(e.g., DNA). My efforts are focused on developing a framework for automatic analyses and visualization of chemical storage clusters.
