I am a Reasearch associate and PhD student at the [Phillipps-Universit√§t Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en) with the mentorship of [Prof. Dominik Heider](http://heiderlab.de/?page_id=146) and [Dr. Georges Hattab](https://ghattab.github.io/). My research lies at the intersection of Bioinformatics, DNA storage, and Data Visualization. Currently, I work on providing solution for long-term information storage problems that are based on the molecular storage media(e.g., DNA). My efforts are focused on developing a framework for automatic analyses and visualization of chemical storage clusters.

Previously, I worked in the field of molecular biology, particularly whole genome sequencing and annotation research, as a research fellow and supervisor at the [International Institute of Tropical Agriculture](https://www.iita.org/)(Ibadan, Nigeria)  with Dr. Andreas Gisel. I has also received a fellowship from the Wellcome Trust (United Kingdom) and H3Africa (South Africa), and earned my masters' degree in computer science, with a specialization in Bioinformatics, from the [University of Ibadan](https://www.ui.edu.ng/). Prior to that, I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science from [Anambra State University, Uli](https://coou.edu.ng/).
